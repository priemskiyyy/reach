# Releasing the packages

All packages share one version line. Each has its own GitHub release tag, and one publishing workflow serves them all. Pushes and verification runs publish nothing.

The release tag uses the package name without its scope: `<name>-v<version>`, for example `reach-netinfo-v0.1.0` for `@priemskiyyy/reach-netinfo`, and `reach-v0.1.0` for the core. The publish workflow resolves the package from the tag, verifies its metadata and changelog entry, runs the test workflows, and publishes the verified tarball from `.artifacts/release/<package>/` with provenance after checking its checksum. It publishes the tarball that was tested, not a rebuild. Prereleases use the `next` dist-tag, and stable releases use `latest`.

Publish `@priemskiyyy/reach` first, then the adapters, then `@priemskiyyy/reach-react` and `@priemskiyyy/reach-tanstack-query`. Dependents declare the matching minor as a peer dependency, so a dependent published before the core cannot be installed.

## Prepare a release

1. Update the package versions and their entries in `CHANGELOG.md` together. Date the entries, because `Unreleased` blocks publishing. An entry's heading is `## <package> <version> - <date>`, and `verify:release` parses it literally.
2. Run `pnpm check:release`. It needs no device, no credentials and no browser.
3. Merge into `main` and check GitHub Actions on that revision.
4. Create a GitHub release with the package's tag. Mark prerelease versions as prereleases.
5. Approve the publish job in the GitHub `npm` environment once its verification jobs pass.

Do not reuse a published version. Prepare a new patch version and changelog entry for a release fix.

## What the release checks do not cover

No adapter runs on a device or in a real browser, in continuous integration or anywhere else in this repository. [The decision record](docs/decisions.md) lists what that leaves unverified. Before a stable release of an adapter, run it once by hand in a real application on each platform it maps, and say in the release notes what you ran.

## npm trusted publishers

All packages use the GitHub owner `priemskiyyy`, repository `reach`, workflow `publish.yml` and environment `npm`. Trusted publishing uses GitHub's short-lived OIDC identity, so the repository needs no npm token.

The first publication of a new package requires an authenticated npm maintainer, because the package must exist before its trusted publisher can be configured. Publish the verified tarball from its artifact directory, then register the workflow. Do not create a GitHub release for that same version afterward.

```sh
npm login
cd .artifacts/release/@priemskiyyy/reach
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
npm publish priemskiyyy-reach-<version>.tgz --access public --tag latest
```

After the publish, register the trusted publisher, then require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens for the package. `npm trust` needs npm 11.15 or later.

```sh
npm trust github @priemskiyyy/reach --file publish.yml --repository priemskiyyy/reach --environment npm --allow-publish
npm access set mfa=publish @priemskiyyy/reach
```
